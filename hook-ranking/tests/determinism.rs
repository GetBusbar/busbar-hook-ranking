//! Invariant test: ranking must be DETERMINISTIC under ties. When two or more candidates present
//! an identical primary ranking key to a native policy, the source (`hook-ranking/src/
//! lib.rs`, `rank_ascending_by` / `rank_descending_by`) breaks the tie by `idx` — the candidate's
//! stable slot in the input slice — via `.then(ia.cmp(ib))` in the sort comparator. That is a
//! total, deterministic secondary key: it is NOT influenced by `HashMap` iteration order, thread
//! scheduling, or any other nondeterministic source, because `DecodedCandidate` and the ranking function
//! operate over a plain `&[DecodedCandidate<'_>]` slice, never a hash-keyed collection.
//!
//! This test builds candidates that tie on every native's primary ranking signal (equal cost,
//! equal latency, equal concurrency headroom, equal rate headroom) and asserts:
//!   1. the output order matches the expected idx-ascending tiebreak rule, and
//!   2. the same input produces the SAME output order across many repeated calls (guards against
//!      any accidental reliance on iteration order that a single run would not reveal).
//!
//! `rank` is the entry point the door's `decide` calls, so exercising it is the most representative
//! path.
